This work aims to contribute to the knowledge of Category 7 (”Galaxies with Jets”) in the Arp  Madore Catalog of Peculiar Galaxies (”A Catalog of Southern PeculiarGalaxies and Association, 1987”). The proposal is the creation of a web system where it will have raw, synthesized spectra and visualizations of the studied objects.
